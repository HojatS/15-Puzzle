Overview:
    involves Search Algorithms,
    in particular, Breadth-First, Depth-First, and A-Star.
    It involves a program that simulates a puzzle called an N-Puzzle:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle
    In our version, the blank space is in the bottom right in the solution and we are working on 3x3 puzzles


Files:
    main.py
        A driver used to run your code (All Algorithms) on all the examples.

    search.py
        A file with 4 algorithms
        BFS, DFS, and 2 A-Stars. 

Example:
	Input File: 
		0 2 3
		1 5 6
		4 7 8
	Input to search function
		puzzle = [[0, 2, 3], [1, 5, 6], [4, 7, 8]]
	Expected Output
		[UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT], using the ENUMS defined in search.py

Notes:
    0 represents the empty space
    Ties should be broken in the order: UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT
    The goal state has the 0 in the bottom right
